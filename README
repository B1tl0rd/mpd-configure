README for mpd-configure
========================

Background
----------

I created this script in an attempt to create a audiophile streaming
audio player using "Music Player Daemon" (MPD) running as a "Linux
Terminal Server Project" (LTSP) client, but it can be used on any
computer running mpd daemon.

The scripts creates a valid mpd configuration file based on the
settings in `mpdconfigure.conf'.

See:

Usage with a fixed installation
-------------------------------

For systems with fixed configuration (eg a PC with a locally installed
mpd, connected to a DAC) the script may be invoked manually:
{{{
./mpd-configure
}}}

This will create the file `.mpdconf' in the current directory. mpd can
than be started and told to use this configuration file:
{{{
mpd .mpdconf
}}}

Alternatively, the resulting configuration file can be copied to the
system wide mpd configuration file:
{{{
sudo cp .mpdconf /etc/mpd.conf
}}}


More dynamic environments
-------------------------

In dynamic environments, for example a network booted ltsp client,
which may be altered each boot, connected to whatever DAC, the script
should be put in a logon script or an init script.

LTSP-specific
-------------

For my LTPS-environment I therefore copy the script directory to the
home directory of the auto logon user specified in
`/var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/lts.conf` and edited it's `~/.profile' to
run the script and start `mpd` using the script generated
`~/.mpdconf`, ie:

{{{
~/mpd-configure/mpd-configure && mpd ~/.mpdconf
}}}


Configuration
-------------

`mpd-configure' tries to create a valid and working configuration file
for "Music Playing Daemon (MPD)" based on relative simple settings
defined in `./mpdconfigure.conf`.


General parameters
------------------

DEBUG           Set to 1 to output values of variables in
                terminal.
		Default: commented (do not show DEBUG information)

DRYRUN		Set to 1 to not write to conffile or set
		volume controls.
		Default: commented (do write to conffile and set
		volume controls).

MPD_HOST	Set the hostname or ip-address you want mpd to bind to.
		Default: 0.0.0.0 (bind to any address)


ENABLE_LASTFM   Set tot 1 to create a playlist plugin section for
	 	LastFM using `LASTFM_USERNAME' and `LAST_PASSWORD'.
		Default: commented (do not create a playlist
		section for LastFM)

ENABLE_ZEROCONF Set to 1 to enable zeroconf.
		Default: commented (do not create a zeroconf section)


Paths
-----

See `man mpd.conf' for explanation.

MPD_MUSICDIR    Set to a valid directory path. 
		Default: $HOME/$XDG_MUSICDIR

MPD_USERHOMEDIR Set to a valid directory path.
		Default: $HOME

MPD_CONFFILE	Set to a valid file path.
		Default: $MPD_USERHOMEDIR/.mpdconf

Alsa and sound
--------------

PREFERREDALSADEVICE This should contain a unique portion of the string
 		returned by `LANG=C aplay -l | grep ^card`. If for
 		example the output is like this:
		 card 1: SB [HDA ATI SB], device 0: ALC662 rev1 Analog [ALC662 rev1 Analog]
		 card 1: SB [HDA ATI SB], device 1: ALC662 rev1 Digital [ALC662 rev1 Digital]

		You could use one of the following values to match
		the second line (hw:1,1):
		 'ALC662 rev1 Digital'
		 'Digital'

		When you have one USB Audio device attached to your computer 
		"USB Audio" will do fine.

		Default: commented (use the first available alsa device)

RESETVOLUME	Set to 1 to set the volume to MASTERVOLUME.
		Default: commented (do not set the volume)

MASTERVOLUME	Specify the level in dB or % to set the volume of
		the ALSADEVICE when RESETVOLUME is enabled.

		In dB: ranging from -110 (silent) to 0 (fully open); 
		ie. '0db' or '-10dB'.

		In %:  ranging from 0 (silent) to 100 (fully open); 
		ie. '100%' or '90%'

		Default: commented (do not set volume)
