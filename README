README for mpd-configure
========================

The `mpd-configure` bash script creates a valid
[mpd](http://www.musicpd.org/) configuration file optimised for
bit perfect playback of any digital audio file, including those of
high resolution.

With default settings the script uses the first available alsa audio
interface by using its hardware address (in the form of `hw:x,y`), and
has automagic procedures for things like the music directory and
directory where files are stored, the number of items in the music
direcory and the UPNP name. When multiple audio interfaces are found,
the user is presented with a choice.


Basic usage
-----------

### Getting the script

The latest stable version of the script may be cloned from github using git:
````bash
git clone https://github.com/ronalde/mpd-configure.git
````

Or downloaded and untarred in the current directory:
````bash
mkdir /tmp/mpd-configure
cd /tmp/mpd-configure
wget http://lacocina.nl/mpd-configure -O - | tar --strip-components=1 -zxf -
````

### Running the script

Run the script with default settings and print the resulting mpd
configuration file to stdout:

````bash
bash mpd-configure
````

### Storing the output of the script in a file

The output can simply be redirected to a file (in this example
`mympd.conf`):
````bash
bash mpd-configure > mympd.conf
````

Although the same may be achieved by setting `CONF_MPD_CONFFILE` on
the command line. This has the *benefit* of having the script
detect if the file `mympd.conf` exists, in which case the user
is prompted to overwrite it, while making an automated *backup* of the
original file:
````bash
CONF_MPD_CONFFILE="mympd.conf" bash mpd-configure
````

Or, in case the script was downloaded correctly with the execute bit set:

````bash
CONF_MPD_CONFFILE="mympd.conf" ./mpd-configure
````

### More advanced usage example

Apart from standard settings all configuration parameters for mpd are
available in configuration snippet files in the `./confs-available/`
directory. By symlinking them to the `./confs-enabled/` directory,
they will be included by the `mpd-configure` script in the resulting
mpd configuration file. Any bash variable in those configuration
snippets, will be expanded to their calculated values by the
script. Any setting may be specified in the file
`./mpd-configure.conf` or on the command line.

For example to specify `CONF_MPD_MUSICDIR` which sets the
`music_directory` and `CONF_MPD_CONFFILE` which specifies the path to
store the resulting configuration file in, run it as follows:
````bash

CONF_MPD_MUSICDIR="/srv/media/music" \
CONF_MPD_CONFFILE="/etc/mpd.conf" \
./mpd-configure
````

By default `mpd-configure` prompts the user when the specified file
already exists, and makes a backup of any existing file.

### Fully automated usage example

A fully automated example which does not prompt the user (by setting
`DISABLE_PROMPTS`), uses the first available USB Audio Class interface
(by setting `LIMIT_INTERFACE_TYPE=usb`) and sets some paths, while
creating a backup of the original `/etc/mpd.conf` in case it exists:

````bash
DISABLE_PROMPTS="True" LIMIT_INTERFACE_TYPE="usb" CONF_MPD_CONFFILE="/etc/mpd.conf" \
CONF_MPD_MUSICDIR="/srv/media/music" CONF_MPD_HOMEDIR="/var/lib/mpd" \
bash mpd-configure
````

. See [Detailed usage instructions](#detailed-usage-instructions) for
more information on the usage and available settings.


About the alsa-capabilities helper script
-----------------------------------------

`mpd-configure` relies on the accompanying bash script `alsa-capabilities` for
getting information about the available audio output interfaces from
alsa. Also offered is the `mpd-monitor' script which shows which parts
of the audio chain are configured for bit perfect audio playback.

`alsa-capabilities` may be run from the commandline. It will then
display each alsa audio output interface with its capabilities, like
the type (ie. Analog, Digital or USB Audio Class) and the native
(digital) audio formats it supports, as well as other properties, like
it's character device (in `/dev/snd`) and the file to watch or monitor
(in `/proc/asound`).

The interfaces returned by the script may be reduced by setting
prefab or custom filters. These options can be displayed by running
the script with the `-h` help option, eg:

````bash
    bash alsa-capabilities -h
````    

The script can also run 'directly' from github using:

````bash
    bash <(wget -q -O - "http://lacocina.nl/alsa-capabilities")
````

To specify an option (like `-l usb`) use the following syntax:

````bash
    bash <(wget -q -O - "http://lacocina.nl/alsa-capabilities") -l usb    
````

To display the alsa playback interfaces on a remote host to which you
have ssh access, use:

````bash
    ssh ${username}@${remotehost} "bash <(wget -q -O - "http://lacocina.nl/alsa-capabilities")"
````

Proper detection of the sample rates each format supports on an
interface currently is very slow for non-USB Audio cards. It therefore
is a non-default option, `-s` or `--samplerates`.

. It is recommended to *mute all output interfaces* because the script
will play (pseudo) random noise on each interface.

Usage:

````bash
bash alsa-capabilities -s   
````

About the mpd-monitor helper script
-----------------------------------

The actual configuration of the system may be inspected/monitored by
the helper script `mpd-monitor`, which can be executed as follows:

````bash
    bash <(wget -q -O - "http://lacocina.nl/mpd-monitor")
````

Or, when mpd is running on a remote host to which you have (key based)
ssh access, execute:

````bash
    ssh ${username}@${remotehost} "bash <(wget -q -O - "http://lacocina.nl/mpd-monitor")"
````

. The mpd-monitor script is in (an unstable) development state.


Background
----------

I created this script to assist users in turning mpd in an audiophile
digital music player. See the article [How to turn Music Player Daemon
(mpd) into an audiophile music
player](http://lacocina.nl/audiophile-mpd).


Detailed usage instructions
---------------------------

For systems with a fixed configuration --eg a PC with a locally
installed mpd connected to some USB DAC or with a internal soundcard--
the script may be invoked manually:

````bash
    bash mpd-configure > mpd.conf
````

or

````bash
    CONF_MPD_CONFFILE="mpd.conf" bash mpd-configure
````

Both will create the file `mpd.conf` in the current directory,
configured to use the first available audio output interface in bit
perfect mode. If more than one output interface (or DAC) is found, it
will prompt you to specify which one to use. As bitperfect mode
assumes that `mpd` has exclusive access to this output interface, the
script will notify the user if its in use.

After creating such a configuration file, `mpd` can be told to use this
configuration file with:

````bash
    mpd ./mpd.conf
````

To use the generated configuration file system wide, it can be copied
to the system wide mpd configuration file when you want to run `mpd`
as a system daemon:

````bash
    sudo cp ~/mpd.conf /etc/mpd.conf
    sudo systemctl restart mpd
````

or directly from the script:
````bash
    sudo CONF_MPD_CONFFILE="/etc/mpd.conf" bash mpd-configure
    sudo systemctl restart mpd
````

Suppose your PC is configured with an internal (embedded) soundcard
and a (single) USB Audio Class external DAC, you may specify the
`LIMIT_INTERFACE_TYPE="usb"` parameter in the `mpd-configure.conf`
file or on the command line, and it will automagically and without
questions configure mpd to use that DAC:

````bash
    LIMIT_INTERFACE_TYPE="usb" bash mpd-configure > ~/mpd.conf
````

Or, when you want to store the results in the system wide mpd
configuration file:
````bash
    sudo LIMIT_INTERFACE_TYPE="usb" CONF_MPD_CONFFILE="/etc/mpd.conf" \
    bash mpd-configure
````


More complex usage
------------------

For debugging or testing purposes one may set the `INCLUDE_COMMENTS`
and/or `DEBUG` parameters through the `mpd-configure.conf` file or on
the command line, eg:

````bash
    DEBUG="True" INCLUDE_COMMENTS="True" bash mpd-configure
````    

In dynamic environments --for example a network booted ltsp client,
which hardware may be altered each boot, connected to whatever DAC--
the script should be put in a logon script or an init script.

### LTSP-specific auto logon sample

For my LTPS-environment I therefore copy the script directory to the
home directory of the auto logon user specified in
`/var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/lts.conf` and edit it's `~/.profile` to
run the script and start `mpd` using the script generated
`~/.mpd/mpd.conf`, ie:

````bash
    systemctl stop mpd && \
    LIMIT_INTERFACE_TYPE="usb" CONF_MPD_CONFFILE=~/.mpd/mpd.conf \
    bash ~/mpd-configure/mpd-configure && \
    systemctl start mpd
````

### Usage from within another bash or sh script

The bash script
[./examples/bash-example.sh](https://github.com/ronalde/mpd-configure/tree/master/examples/bash-example.sh)
demonstrates the way alsa-capabilities can be used from another bash
script.

This demo script returns the monitoring file of the file specified as an argument:

````bash
bash examples/bash-example.sh hw:1,0
````

Result:
````bash
the audio card with alsa hardware address hw:1,0 can be monitored with:
/proc/asound/card1/stream0
````


### Usage from within python

Assuming your in the `mpd-configure` directory, run:
````bash
    python examples/get-interfaces.py
````

The python script
[./examples/get-interfaces.py](https://github.com/ronalde/mpd-configure/tree/master/examples/get-interfaces.py)
uses a helper bash script
([./examples/get-interfaces-for-python.sh](https://github.com/ronalde/mpd-configure/tree/master/examples/get-interfaces-for-python.sh)),
which in turn sources `alsa-capabilities`.


Preferences
-----------

Preferences can be set in the file `mpd-configure.conf`. By default all
preferences are commented out.


### General parameters

`DEBUG`
Output values of variables and program flow to std_err for easier
debugging. Possible values:
- commented out: disabled (Default).
- `1` (or non-empty): enabled.


`INCLUDE_COMMENTS`
Include commented and empty lines from configuration snippet files in
the generated mpd configuration file:
- commentend out: disabled (Default).
- `1` (or non-empty): enabled


`MPD_CONFFILE`
Path to where the generated mpd configuration file will be
written. Possible values:
- commented out: don't write to a file (Default). One may redirect the
  output of the script using:

  bash mpd-configure > /path/to/mpd.conf

- `/path/to/mpd.conf`: use the path specified.


### Alsa and sound

`LIMIT_INTERFACE_TYPE`
A keyword which limits the type of alsa interfaces to be returned: 

Possible values:
- `usb`, `digital` or `analog`
- Comment it out (or leave it empty) to prevent filtering.

Default value:
- commented out (or empty ""): do not limit the interfaces that will be found.


`LIMIT_INTERFACE_FILTER`
The available output devices (after filtering with
`LIMIT_INTERFACE_TYPE` when applicable) may be further limited using a
regular expression (which thus is case sensentive) which should match
the output of:

    LANG=C aplay -l | grep ^card

If for example the output is like this:

    card 0: MID [HDA Intel MID], device 0: HDMI 0 [HDMI 0]
    card 1: receiv [Pink Faun USB 32/384 USB receiv], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]

... you could use one of the following values to match the *second* line
(which in this example matches the alsa `hw:1,1` interface, eg. the
second interface of the second sound card):

    "USB Audio"
    "[uU][sS][bB] \w+ "

but not

    "USB audio"


Possible values:
- empty or commented out: no filtering is applied
- `Some regular expression`: use the (first) interface which matches the regexp.

Default value:
- commented out (or empty ""): use the first available interface. 

Handling of pulseaudio
`OPT_DISABLE_PULSEAUDIO`
Disable pulseaudio by modifyin the current users' `~/.pulseaudio/client.conf`

Possible values:
- non-empty (`1` or "True") disables pulseaudio.
- Comment it out (or leave it empty) to prevent disabling of pulseaudio.


Default value:
- commented out (or empty ""): do not disable it.

`OPT_STOP_PULSEAUDIO`
Temporary disable and stop pulseaudio during detection of alsa
interfaces. After the script pulseaudio's client configuration and run
state will restored.

Possible values:
- non-empty (`1` or "True") temporary disables and stops pulseaudio.
- Comment it out (or leave it empty) to prevent temporary disabling
  and stopping of pulseaudio.

Default value:
- commented out (or empty ""): do not disable it.


See the configuration snippet files and accompanying `README` in
`./confs-available` for additional parameters and and explanation for
their functions.
